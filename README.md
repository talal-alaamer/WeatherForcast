# Objective
The objective is to examine vast volumes of data and find patterns that may be utilized to produce more precise forecasts. Data mining can be used to enhance weather forecasting. It may be used to study past weather data and spot trends that can be used to forecast weather conditions in the future. To provide more precise short-term weather forecasts, data mining may also be utilized to analyze real-time weather data and find trends.
